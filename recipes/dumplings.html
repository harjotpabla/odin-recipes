        <h3>Perfect drop dumplings for stew.</h3>
        <p>These drop dumplings are very easy to make and are a perfect touch for hearty chicken or beef stew.</p>
        <p>Although you still may be frightened by having to make your own dumplings, it's very easy and it only uses a few ingredients.</p>
        <p>So don't worry and get started with the ingredients!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients (from website)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup milk (to moisten)</li>
            <li>Beef or chicken stew (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps (from webiste)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut in the butter and parsley (if using) until blended using a fork.</li>
            <li>Stir in the milk to form a wet dough. It should be a thick dough but thin enough to drop from a wet spoon.</li>
            <li>Heat the stew until it is simmering. Drop spoonfuls of the soft dough onto the simmering stew. Try to drop the dumplings on top of the vegetables so they won't sink too far into the liquid.</li>
            <li>Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes and then cover the pan tightly and cook for about 10 minutes longer (20 minutes total). Stir a few times to keep the stew from scorching.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
